# Attention based Neural Networks for Chemical Protein Relation

* Task description: http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-vi/track-5/
* Data (may require login): http://www.biocreative.org/accounts/login/?next=/resources/corpora/chemprot-corpus-biocreative-vi/


## Prerequisites

* Python 2.7
* TensorFlow 1.2.1
* Keras 2.0.5
* NLTK
* Scikit-learn
* ConfigParser

## Usage

### Update configuration file
 Go through the config file `config/main_config.ini` to modify the
 following paths
 accordingly.
 * `corpus_dir`: unzipped corpus directory
 * `out_dir`: the output directory of preprocessed file

### Preprocessing
```
python extract_sentences.py
```

By default, you will see the relation instances of train, dev and test
sets under `out_dir`: `training.txt`, `development.txt` and `test.txt`.

### Encode Sentences

Load word embeddings and generate word index (word2id) for the corpus by
 running:
```
python preprocess.py
```

A subset of word embeddings, vocabulary, and sentencse are stored under
the compressed pkl file
 `pkl/bioc_rel_ent_candidate.pkl.gz`

### Train Models

Load the encoded sentences, initalize model parameters, compile
Tensorflow and Keras models, and run training and testing on
the dataset by:

```
python dnn.py
```

The output file is in [Brat standoff format](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html),
the same as the gold standard files. Each epoch of ATT-GRU will take 83
seconds on a NVIDIA Tesla P40 GPU to complete.


The offical envaluation script can be downloaded at the offical site:
 [ChemProt evaluation kit](http://www.biocreative.org/media/store/files/2017/evaluation-kit.zip)
A copy is also provided under `./eval` for the convenience of usage, and it will be called
automatically after the output file on the test set is generented.

The official result is:

```
Total annotations: 3458
Total predictions: 2939
TP: 1687
FN: 1771
FP: 1252
Precision: 0.5740047635250085
Recall: 0.48785425101214575
F-score: 0.5274347350320463
```

The confusion matrix and classification report will also be printed.

## Acknowledgment

The relation classification architechture is based on the
 [Relation CNN implementation](https://github.com/UKPLab/deeplearning4nlp-tutorial/tree/master/2017-07_Seminar/Session%203%20-%20Relation%20CNN)
from [UKPLab](https://github.com/UKPLab).

The attention RNN is inspired by the [code snippet](https://gist.github.com/cbaziotis/7ef97ccf71cbc14366835198c09809d2) from cbaziotis.
